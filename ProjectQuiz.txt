What is a Content Delivery Network (CDN)?  List and explain at least FOUR advantages in using a CDN.

- CDN is a network of servers that speed up load time by delivering cache webpages and their content to users based on the users geographical location. Four advantages to using a CDN are:
 	1. A CDN reduces the number of hops a data packet must make and significantly reduces the distance data must travel. 
2. Faster performance, lower network latency and lower packet loss
3. Since a CDN can distribute the load and save bandwidth it can reduce you hosting costs.
4. CDN offer an almost limitless scalability at a fraction of the cost that it would cost you to individual set up such a network. 
5. CDNâ€™s offer different domains and therefore increase the concurrent connections to your website.
